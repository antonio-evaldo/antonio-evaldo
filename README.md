# Hello :)

My name is AntÃ´nio Evaldo, I'm an Electrical Engineering student âš¡ at the Federal University of PiauÃ­ (UFPI) and member of the Tutorial Education Program (PET) of the Electrical Engineering course.

I entered the world of web development in early 2020 to maintain a private project of my university, an internal management system made with the basic front-end technologies with Bootstrap and Jquery, and PHP and SQL in the back-end. Since then I fell in love for this world and also started studying other technologies in my free time.

My current focus is on front-end, mainly React, which I have basic domain, and I'm occasionaly looking for learning more about the Javascript ecossistem (for example Next.js), as well as to keep practicing my programming skills.
 
This is it, don't mind my English since it's not my native language and thanks for reading all the way until here ðŸ˜Š
