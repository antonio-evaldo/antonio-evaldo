# Hello :)

My name is Antônio Evaldo, I'm an Electrical Engineering student at the Federal University of Piauí (UFPI) and an intern of the Scuba Team at Alura.

I entered the world of web development in early 2020 to maintain a private project of my university, learning and praticing the basics of front-end and back-end. Since then I fell in love for the world of technology.

At Alura I'm really glad to pratice my knowlodge and to help other people to enter this world. Teaching others is a lovely way to learn more and go farther.
